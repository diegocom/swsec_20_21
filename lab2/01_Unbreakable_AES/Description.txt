unbreakable_aes implements the revolutionary cryptographic algorithm Another Encryption Scheme, which relies on elliptic quantum crypto kitties. Unfortunately, this implementation can be only used to encrypt files, since it lacks a decryption function.

You are given flag.txt.aes and your job is to break the unbreakable! Good luck
